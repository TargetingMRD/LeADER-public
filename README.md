## About LeADER
LeADER is a data exploration platform supporting cancer clinical trials and related laboratory studies at Harvard Medical School. Multidisciplinary research groups have historically had few tools for complex integrative analyses. LeADER bridges the data accessibility gap between bioengineers, bench scientists, and clinicians and thereby advance translational medicine. By linking clinical and biological features of patients, their tumor samples, and single tumor cells, it allows all collaborators to independently interrogate harmonized, real-time data using interactive visualization and analysis tools. A hierarchical implementation with methods like parent-child rows and graph databases stretches existing Shiny functionality to facilitate seamless interaction with complex data.

## About US
LeADER is created by a group of data visualization interns in the lab of Mark A. Murakami, M.D. at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School.

The Murakami laboratory at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute works to define mechanisms of resistance and minimal residual disease (MRD) in B-cell malignancies and translate discoveries into novel therapies through clinical trials. Our overarching goal is to advance new therapeutic strategies to overcome MRD and cure patients with B-cell leukemias and lymphomas.
